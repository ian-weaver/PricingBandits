ExpectedRewardsTV(
  Prices,
  Seeds,
  NumIter,
  SeasonLength,
  Rho,
  DistrType,
  ShapeA,
  ShapeB
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Prices}{A vector of prices in the test set.}

\item{Seeds}{A vector of random seeds used to generate different demand realizations.}

\item{NumIter}{Integer. Number of iterations (consumers) in each simulation run.}

\item{SeasonLength}{Number of consumers per season; determines the frequency of seasonal demand shifts.}

\item{Rho}{Maximum seasonal shock; actual shocks are drawn uniformly from \code{[-Rho, Rho]}.}

\item{DistrType}{Distribution type for baseline valuations (e.g., 'beta').}

\item{ShapeA}{Beta distribution parameter.}

\item{ShapeB}{Beta distribution parameter.}
}
\value{
A matrix of expected rewards with rows corresponding to each seed and columns corresponding to priceâ€“season combinations.
}
\description{
Computes expected rewards over multiple pricing periods in a time-varying demand setting, where consumer valuations shift according to a seasonal shock process.
