\arguments{
\item{PricesTested}{A vector of prices (values between 0 and 1) that have been tested so far in the experiment.}

\item{PurchaseDecisions}{A vector of associated purchase decisions for the prices tested.}

\item{TestX}{A set of prices (values between 0 and 1) to test.}

\item{Knots}{Knots for the basis functions used in the regression.}

\item{sigma2_y}{Observation noise variance (must be less than 0.25).}

\item{BatchSize}{Number of consumers tested before an algorithm can update.}

\item{BasisFunctions}{Basis functions for the monotonic Gaussian Process regression.}

\item{LB1}{Lower bound for the test prices.}

\item{LB2}{Lower bound for the knots.}

\item{UB}{Upper bound for both test prices and knots.}
}
\value{
A vector of action scores for the prices in `TestX`.
}
\description{
This function implements the monotonic Gaussian Process Thompson Sampling (GPTS_Mono) policy for pricing experiments.
It uses Gaussian Process regression to generate posterior predictions and action scores while ensuring monotonicity.
