\usage{
SubsetResults(
  ResultsList,
  DistrClass,
  policies,
  arm = NULL,
  beta = NULL,
  zeta = NULL,
  rho = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResultsList}{A named list containing simulation results from various bandit experiments}

\item{DistrClass}{The type of distribution ('analytic', 'empirical', 'leftdigit', 'timevarying').}

\item{policies}{A vector of policy names (e.g., "TS", "GPTS") to filter results.}

\item{arm}{The number of arms as a character string (e.g., "10").}

\item{beta}{The beta distribution type as a character string (e.g., "29" for Beta(2,9)).}

\item{zeta}{Scaling factor for the discontinuity gap as a character string. (e.g., "20")}

\item{rho}{Maximum seasonal shock as a character string. (e.g., "01")}
}
\value{
A named list containing only the simulation results matching the specified criteria.
}
\description{
This function extracts a subset of simulation results from a larger list based on the
specified distribution class, bandit policy, and identifying parameters such as the 
number of arms, beta shape, gap parameter (zeta), or seasonal shock (rho).
